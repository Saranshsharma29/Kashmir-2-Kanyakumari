                <p class="center">Amarnath is in Jammu and Kashmir. It is famous for the holy cave, which houses a naturally formed ‘shivalinga’ of ice. You can reach here only after a very difficult trek.
                     The place holds great religious importance as it is where Lord Shiva revealed the secret of immortality to Parvati which was heard by a pair of pigeons as well. These pigeons can be seen
                      in the cave today. Every year, the ‘linga’ is created by ice naturally and people visit it through the annual Amarnath Yatra.<br>
